    <h3 class = "about"> My name is Katelyn Leung and I created this project during the Summer Immersion Program at Girls Who Code. I chose to create a website about Mental Health because I want people to be more aware of mental health issues because they are very important to our lives and can have a significant impact in everyday lives. </h3>
